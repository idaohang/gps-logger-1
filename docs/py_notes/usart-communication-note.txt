To communicate with gps module, first we need to set up the the connection between the USART pin.

For this project, we will be using only pin PD2 and PD3 for the communication.

USART Initialisation
--------------------
The USART has to be initialized before any communication can take place. The initialization process normally consists of setting the baud rate, setting frame format and enabling the Transmitter or the Receiver depending on the usage. 

Setting up baud rate.
---------------------
The suitable baud rate to be use with external oscillator of 7.3728Hz is 38400 and ST22 GPS Module are capable of using that baud rate.

UBRR = 0x00B; or in integer format UBRR = 11;

#define UART_BAUD_RATE 11

Configuring general I/O pins
----------------------------
The DDxn bit in the DDRx Register selects the direction of this pin. If DDxn is written logic one, Pxn is configured as an output pin. If DDxn is written logic zero, Pxn is configured as an input pin.

More information on page 73.

Configuring PD2 and PD3
-----------------------
More information on page 90.

This signal need to be send to enable the pin PD2 and PD3 as Input and Output for the USART data. Signal: DDOE. But doing so will ignore the bit set at DDD3.

So what I am gonna do here is not using the signal above but setting the Data Direction Register for each pin that I am going to use:

DDD3 in DDRD to 1

and

DDD2 in DDRD to 0

Register Description
--------------------
More information about register is on page 91.

Interrupt
---------
The interrupts information is on the page 61 in the data sheet for Atmega 324p.

Initialising USART for Receiving and Trasmitting Data
-----------------------------------------------------
Read more on page 177.

void USART_Init(unsigned int ubrr_value)
{
	// Setting baud rate
	UBRRHn = (unsigned char)(ubrr_value>>8);
	UBRRLn = (unsigned char)ubrr_value;

	// Enable reciever and transmitter
	UCSRnB |= (1<<RXENn)|(1<<TXENn);

	// Set frame format: 8 bits data, 2 stop bits
	UCSRnC = (1<<USBSn)|(3<<UCSZn0);
}

Transmitting Data using USART
-----------------------------
Read more on page 178.

void USART_Transmit(unsigned char data)
{
	/* Wait for empty transmit buffer, wait for the transmit buffer to be ready */
	while (!( UCSRnA & (1<<UDREn)));

	/* Put data into buffer, sends the data */
	UDRn = data;
}

Receiving Data using USART
--------------------------
unsigned char USART_Receive( void )
{
	/* Wait for data to be received */
	while(!(UCSRnA & (1<<RXCn)));
	
	/* Get and return received data from buffer */
	return UDRn;
}



Setting GPS Module Baud Rate
----------------------------
Setting the baud rate to 38400:
A0 A1 00 04 05 00 03 01 07 0D 0A

Configure NMEA Message
----------------------
Setting the NMEA Message only for GLL:
A0 A1 00 09 08 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 08 0D 0A

System Position Rate
--------------------
Setting the update rate to 2Hz:
A0 A1 00 03 0E 02 00 0F 0D 0A
